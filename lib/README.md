# Home Python models

This directory contains Python models I use for helping to manage my home assistant configuration. It was primarily used when starting out with HA, and often had to rebuild things. It is not actively used in any part of my HA deployment itself.

Most often I would use it to generate dashboards or YAML configuration files that would then be deployed to HA.
